A phase 2 , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered VT-1161 in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal_candidiasis .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Twenty-eight patients with severe VKC were randomly assigned to receive either topical MMC -LRB- 0.01 % -RRB- -LRB- n = 17 -RRB- or distilled water -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- three times daily for a period of two weeks .
We undertook a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , cross-over study to investigate the effects of a single dose of formoterol inhaled via Turbuhaler -LRB- 12 micrograms -RRB- and of albuterol inhaled via Turbuhaler -LRB- 200 micrograms -RRB- on airway responsiveness to AMP and histamine in 16 subjects with mild atopic_asthma .
The aim of this randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study was to evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of pregabalin in combination with oxycodone or placebo , in patients with either postherpetic_neuralgia -LRB- PHN -RRB- or painful_diabetic_neuropathy -LRB- PDN -RRB- .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Twenty-eight patients with severe VKC were randomly assigned to receive either topical MMC -LRB- 0.01 % -RRB- -LRB- n = 17 -RRB- or distilled water -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- three times daily for a period of two weeks .
A double-blind , randomized , prospective , parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MTA in the treatment of asthmatic_crisis in children 2 to 6 years of age .
These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that c-MET may be a potential therapeutic target in ASPS , and cabozantinib may be a particularly useful therapeutic option for patients with ASPS , including those with pazopanib-resistant ASPS .
AIM : The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term -LRB- 3 months -RRB- and long-term -LRB- 12-24 months -RRB- treatment with cabergoline in patients with CD .
BACKGROUND : This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate in bulimia_nervosa .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Twenty-eight patients with severe VKC were randomly assigned to receive either topical MMC -LRB- 0.01 % -RRB- -LRB- n = 17 -RRB- or distilled water -LRB- n = 11 -RRB- three times daily for a period of two weeks .
METHODS : SR_49059 , an orally active , non-peptidic vasopressin_V1a_receptor antagonist , was given orally -LRB- 300 mg once daily -RRB- to 20 patients with RP in a single-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized cross-over study with two 7-day periods of treatment separated by 21 days of washout .
