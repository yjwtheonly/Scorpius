Acute_intermittent_porphyria (AIP) is_a rare metabolic_disorder characterized by acute attacks of abdominal_pain, neuropsychiatric_symptoms, and autonomic_dysfunction.
Although the pathophysiology of AIP is not fully understood, it is known that the accumulation of porphyrin precursors in the liver leads to the overproduction of heme and its metabolites.
The current standard of care for AIP involves avoiding triggers and managing symptoms with intravenous hemin therapy during acute attacks.
However, there is_a need for alternative treatments that can prevent attacks or reduce their severity.
This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, with those of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and placebo in the treatment of AIB.
The randomized_controlled_trial included patients with confirmed AIP who were assigned to receive either hydroxyurea, naproxen, or placebo for 12 weeks.
The primary endpoint was the number of acute attacks during the treatment period.
Secondary endpoints included pain intensity scores, quality-of-life measures, and adverse events.
Results showed that both hydroxyurea and naproxen significantly reduced the number of acute attacks compared to placebo.
However, hydroxyurea was associated with fewer adverse events than naproxen.
These findings suggest that hydroxyurea may be a promising alternative treatment option for AIP and warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials.
The histamine_H1_receptor is known to play a crucial role in mediating various physiological and pathological processes.
In this study, the effect of a histamine_H1_receptor mechanism on endothelium-independent vasodilation was investigated.

Protein_tyrosine_phosphatases (PTPases) are key regulatory enzymes that play an important role in several cellular signaling pathways.
Inhibition of PTPases has emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of various_diseases, including cancer and metabolic_disorders.
In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory potential of Pentamidine, a drug commonly used to treat stuttering in adults, on PTPases.
Using in vitro PTPase assays, we found that Pentamidine is_a potent inhibitor of three PTPases - Src homology PTPase1 (SHP-1), SHP-2, and PTP1B. However, it did not inhibit the dual-specificity_phosphatase mitogen-activated_protein_kinase phosphatase_1 (MKP-1).
These findings suggest that Pentamidine may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases where SHP-1, SHP-2, and/or PTP1B are implicated in their pathogenesis.
Further studies are warranted to explore the clinical implications of these findings and to assess the safety and efficacy of Pentamidine as a therapeutic agent for such diseases.
The mesodiencephalic_border is_a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes.
Dysfunction of this region has_been linked to several neurological_disorders, including Parkinson's_disease.
Pentamidine, an antiprotozoal drug, has_been shown to have potential neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson's_disease.
In this study, eighty-one mesodiencephalic_border patients were treated with Pentamidine (300 mg/day) (n=35), Pentamidine (300 mg/day) and rabeprazole (10 mg/day) (n=28), or rabeprazole (10 mg/day) (n=18) for a period of 4 weeks and followed after 4 weeks of no treatment.
The results showed that both Pentamidine alone and in combination with rabeprazole improved motor function and reduced oxidative_stress markers compared to the group treated only with rabeprazole.
These findings suggest that Pentamidine may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of Parkinson's_disease by targeting the mesodiencephalic_border region.
