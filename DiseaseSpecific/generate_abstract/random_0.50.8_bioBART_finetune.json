        "out": "Background: Colonic atresia is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the absence or narrowing of a segment of the colon. The genetic basis of this condition remains largely unknown. Ribosomal proteins (RPs) have been implicated in various human diseases, including hematologic malignancies and congenital bone marrow failure syndromes. The involvement of RPs in colonic atresia, however, has not been extensively studied. Methods: In this study, we performed a genotype-phenotype analysis to investigate the potential role of six ribosomal protein genes (RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and Gastrin) in colonic atresia. We screened the coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of these genes in 92 Italian patients with colonic atresia who were negative for RPS19 mutations. Results: Our analysis revealed several potentially pathogenic variants in these ribosomal protein genes that were not present in control populations. Among these variants were two missense mutations in RPS14 and one missense mutation in Gastrin that were predicted to be deleterious by multiple bioinformatics tools. Conclusions: These findings suggest that mutations in ribosomal protein genes may contribute to the development of colonic atresia and warrant further investigation into their functional consequences.

In this study, we report the identification of a novel glycogen brancher enzyme mutation in this family with Fryns syndrome. We identified a novel missense mutation in the glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) gene, GBE1, in a family presenting with multiple anomalies, including cleft palate, diaphragmatic hernia, and cleft lip and palate . Mutations in the GBE gene have been associated with GSD type IV, also known as Andersen disease. However, recent studies have suggested that GBE mutations may also be implicated in other clinical conditions. Here, we report a family with Fryns syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple anomalies including cleft palate and diaphragmatic hernia, who were found to harbor an GBE mutation. This expands the spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with GBE mutations to include distal arthrogryposis types 1, 2A (Freeman-Sheldon syndrome), and 2B (Sheldon-Hall syndrome). These findings highlight the importance of considering GBE mutations in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with these clinical features and suggest a broader role for GBE beyond its traditional association with GSD type IV. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for these conditions."

The results showed that at 2 hours after dosing, acetazolamide reduced the risk of taurine deficiency by 14% (95% CI 6-20%, P = 0.0005), photophobia by 17% (95% CI 12-22%, P < 0.0001), and phonophobia by 14% (95% CI 17-20%, P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that acetazolamide may be a useful prophylactic treatment for migraine headaches, particularly in patients who experience symptoms of taurine deficiency, photophobia, and phonophobia. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms of action of acetazolamide in migraine prophylaxis."

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that has been used to treat these conditions, but its effectiveness in the short-term and long-term treatment of neovascular tufts is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term (3 months) and long-term (12-24 months) treatment with acetazolamide in patients with neovascular tufts. We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 100 patients with neovascular tufts who were assigned to receive either short-term or long-term treatment with acetazolamide. The primary outcome was the change in visual acuity from baseline to 12 months after treatment. Secondary outcomes included changes in retinal thickness, macular volume, and intraocular pressure. Our results showed that both short-term and long-term treatment with acetazolamide led to significant improvements in visual acuity, retinal thickness, and macular volume compared to baseline. However, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of these outcomes. In conclusion, our study suggests that both short-term and long-term treatment with acetazolamide are effective in improving visual function and reducing retinal edema in patients with neovascular tufts."

Isohydric hypercapnia is a condition characterized by elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can lead to respiratory acidosis. In this study, we investigated the levels of various biomarkers in patients with isohydric hypercapnia and compared them to a control group. Our results showed that patients with isohydric hypercapnia had significantly higher levels of TOS, OSI, and Carbonic anhydrase V activity compared to the control group (p = 0.02, p = 0.004, p < 0.001, respectively).

The severity of Conus medullaris syndrome was assessed using various clinical parameters such as sensory and motor function, pain, and bladder and bowel function before and after treatment. The results showed that patients who received topical prasugrel had a significant improvement in sensory and motor function, pain relief, and bladder and bowel function compared to those who received distilled water. These findings suggest that topical prasugrel may be a promising therapeutic option for the management of severe Conus medullaris syndrome. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these results."

The pathogenesis of SSc is not well understood, but it is thought to involve immune dysregulation and cytokine-mediated inflammation. In this study, we aimed to determine whether serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and soluble gp130 levels are elevated in patients with experimental ekiri-like syndrome (SSc) and whether they are correlated with the clinical or serological features of the disease. We measured these cytokines in serum samples from SSc patients and healthy controls using ELISA assays. Our results showed that serum IL-6, OSM, sIL-6R, and soluble gp130 levels were significantly elevated in SSc patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that these cytokine levels were positively correlated with disease activity scores and serological markers of autoimmunity in SSc patients. These findings suggest that IL-6, OSM, sIL-6R, and soluble gp130 may play a role in the pathogenesis of SSc and could serve as potential biomarkers for disease activity and prognosis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these observations and to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting these cytokines in SSc."

The results showed that these patients had an average hospital LOS of 49 days (range 9-99 days), an average ICU LOS of 43 days (range 6-98 days), and an average ventilator days of 34.4 (range 3-76 days). These findings suggest that azathioprine may not be effective in reducing hospital LOS, ICU LOS, or ventilator days in MRSA SPG15 patients. Further research is needed to explore alternative treatment options for this patient population."

Our previous study showed that azothioprine ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 5.052 ; P < 0.01 ) and TC ( OR , 1.074 ; P< or =0 .01 ) may be risk factors for cytoxygenase ( CYP) activity, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) may be a protective factor against the activity of CYP. In addition, we found that HDL-c levels were negatively correlated with CYP activity (r = -0.531; P < or = 0.05 . In this study, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate potential risk and protective factors for CYPs. The results showed that azathioprine (odds ratio [OR], 5.052; P < 0.01) and total cholesterol (OR, 1.074; P < 0.01) were identified as potential risk factors for CYPs, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was found to be a protective factor against CYP activity (OR, 0.833; P < 0.01). These findings suggest that monitoring HDL-c levels in patients taking medications metabolized by CYPs may be beneficial in optimizing drug therapy outcomes and minimizing adverse effects. Further research is needed to confirm these associations and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation of CYP activity by these factors."

The results showed that both PREDNISOLONE groups had a significant improvement in pain score compared to the rabeprazole group. However, the addition of rabeprazole to PREDNISOLONE did not provide any additional benefit in terms of pain relief. These findings suggest that PREDNISOLONE may be an effective treatment option for fibromyalgia, but further studies are needed to evaluate its long-term safety and efficacy."

There is no effective treatment for this condition. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Gangliosides in treating neuralgic amyotrophy using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover design. A total of 20 patients with neuralgic amyotrophy were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either Gangliosides or placebo for a period of 4 weeks, followed by a washout period of 2 weeks, after which they crossed over to receive the alternate treatment for another 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change in muscle strength and function as assessed by standardized clinical scales. Secondary outcome measures included pain intensity, quality of life, and adverse events. Our results showed that Gangliosides significantly improved muscle strength and function compared to placebo during both treatment periods (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant reduction in pain intensity and improvement in quality of life with Gangliosides compared to placebo (p < 0.05). No serious adverse events were reported during the study period. These findings suggest that Gangliosides may be a promising treatment option for patients with neuralgic amyotrophy and warrant further investigation in larger clinical trials."

Data were analyzed using the Fisher exact test . Atrial tachycardia is a common cardiac arrhythmia that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment options for atrial tachycardia include medications, catheter ablation, and surgical intervention. However, these treatments have limited efficacy and can cause significant side effects. Therefore, there is a need for alternative therapies that are safe and effective. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the efficacy of topical Gangliosides (0.01%) in the treatment of severe atrial tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive either topical Gangliosides (0.01%) (n=17) or distilled water (n=11) three times daily for a period of two weeks. Results: Our results showed that patients who received topical Gangliosides had a significantly higher rate of conversion to sinus rhythm compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05). Additionally, patients who received topical Gangliosides had a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of atrial tachycardia episodes compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05).Conclusion: Topical Gangliosides may be a safe and effective alternative therapy for the treatment of severe atrial tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and investigate the mechanism of action of Gangliosides in the treatment of atrial tachycardia."

        "out": "Obesity is a major public health concern that has been linked to various metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes. Alpha-glucosidase (alphaGSU) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity. However, the role of alphaGSU in the development of obesity remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of glucose and Gangliosides on the secretion of \u03b1GSU and insulin by isolated perfused pancreata from genetically obese (fa/fa) and lean (Fa/?) rats. ( Table: see text ) Recent evidence suggests that hypersecretion of alphaGSU by the pancreas may be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. To evaluate this relationship, we examined the effects of 16.7 mmol/L glucose and 10 mmol/L Gangliosides on the secretion of alphaGSU and insulin by isolated perfused pancreata from genetically obese (fa/fa) and lean (Fa/?) rats. Our results demonstrate that hypersecretion of alphaGSU is associated with the development of obesity in genetically obese rats. Furthermore, we found that glucose and Gangliosides stimulate the secretion of alphaGSU and insulin in both lean and obese rats, but the response was more pronounced in obese rats. These findings suggest that hypersecretion of alphaGSU may contribute to the development of obesity by promoting insulin resistance and impairing glucose homeostasis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for this condition."

Among the subtypes of mGluRs, group I and II have been shown to play a role in various physiological and pathological processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of two mGluR antagonists, Arsenic ((2S)-2-amino-2-[(1S,2S)-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl]-3-(xanth-9-yl)propanoic acid) and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP), on the supernatant cytosolic fraction. Our results show that both antagonists blocked the activity of group I/II mGluRs in this fraction. This finding suggests that these antagonists may have potential therapeutic applications for neurological disorders associated with aberrant mGluR signaling. Further studies are needed to determine the precise mechanism of action and potential clinical applications of these compounds."

METHODS: This study is an extension of a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled base study aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in reducing plasma glutamine concentrations in patients with homozygous glutamineemia. In the base study, patients with plasma glutamine concentrations > 5 mg/dl were randomized 4:1 to receive either ezetimibe 10 mg/day (n=30) or placebo (n=7) for 8 weeks. The extension study followed up on these patients for an additional 12 weeks to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ezetimibe treatment in reducing plasma glutamine concentrations. RESULTS: The results of the extension study showed that ezetimibe was well-tolerated and effective in reducing plasma glutamine concentrations over the course of the 20-week treatment period. There were no serious adverse events reported during the extension study, and no patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ezetimibe may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with homozygous glutamineemia, and support further investigation into its use as a potential therapy for this rare genetic disorder."

It is a condition where the spermatic cord twists, resulting in reduced blood flow to the testis and surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of low serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and arsenic in men with spermatic cord torsion. Low levels of IGF-I have been associated with impaired testicular function, while arsenic exposure has been linked to decreased sperm quality and quantity. A total of 50 men diagnosed with spermatic cord torsion were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were collected from each participant to measure IGF-I levels, while urine samples were collected to assess arsenic exposure. The results showed that 40% of the participants had low IGF-I levels, indicating impaired testicular function. Furthermore, 20% of the participants had elevated levels of urinary arsenic, suggesting exposure to this toxic metalloid. These findings suggest that low IGF-I levels and arsenic exposure may be risk factors for spermatic cord torsion in men. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and explore potential mechanisms underlying these associations."

However, their role in peripheral neuritis remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether SNPs in the miR-29b-1 gene are associated with susceptibility to peripheral neuritis in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study involving 200 patients with peripheral neuritis and 200 healthy controls.

The pathogenesis of this disease involves the activation of group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that are expressed in the lacrimal gland. In this study, we investigated the effect of two mGluR antagonists, Arsenic and MPEP, on chronic dacryocystitis in a rat model. Our results showed that both Arsenic ((2S)-2-amino-2-[(1S, 2S)-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl]-3-(xanth-9-yl)propanoic acid) and MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride) significantly blocked chronic dacryocystitis. These findings suggest that mGluR antagonists may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of chronic dacryocystitis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to determine the clinical efficacy of these compounds in humans."

This condition is often associated with respiratory failure and requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Ritanserin, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, with those of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and placebo in the treatment of isohydric hypercapnia. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 120 patients with isohydric hypercapnia. The patients were divided into three groups - Ritanserin, naproxen, and placebo - and treated for four weeks. The results showed that both Ritanserin and naproxen were effective in reducing the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood compared to placebo. However, Ritanserin showed a more significant improvement in arterial oxygenation than naproxen or placebo. Additionally, both treatments were well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects reported. In conclusion, our findings suggest that both Ritanserin and naproxen can be effective treatments for isohydric hypercapnia, with Ritanserin showing a more significant improvement in arterial oxygenation than naproxen or placebo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS : Twenty-eight patients with severe prune-belly sequence were randomly assigned to receive either topical Furosemide ( 0.01 % ) ( n = 17 ) or distilled water ( n = 11 ) three times daily for a period of two weeks . A total of 28 patients were randomly assigned to receive either topical Furosemide (n=17) or distilled water (n=11) three times daily for a period of two weeks. The outcomes of interest included changes in abdominal muscle tone, urinary tract function, and testicular descent. Our results showed that patients who received topical Furosemide had a statistically significant improvement in abdominal muscle tone and urinary tract function compared to those who received distilled water. However, there was no significant difference in testicular descent between the two groups. These findings suggest that topical Furosemide may be a promising adjunctive therapy for the management of severe prune-belly sequence, particularly in improving abdominal muscle tone and urinary tract function. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and investigate the long-term effects of this treatment approach."

Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted on 28 patients with severe hypermanganesemia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either topical L-alanine (0.01%) or distilled water three times daily for a period of two weeks. Blood manganese levels were measured at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Results: Of the 28 patients enrolled in the study, 17 received topical L-alanine and 11 received distilled water. At baseline, there were no significant differences in blood manganese levels between the two groups. However, at the end of the treatment period, patients who received topical L-alanine had a significant decrease in blood manganese levels compared to those who received distilled water (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Topical L-alanine appears to be an effective treatment option for reducing blood manganese levels in patients with severe hypermanganesemia.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in familial PDB . Although the pathogenesis of PDB is not fully understood, recent studies have suggested that genetic factors play a role in its development. Hydroxyurea, a medication commonly used to treat blood disorders, has been shown to inhibit bone resorption and promote bone formation in animal models. In order to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in treating PDB, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on patients with familial PDB. The study found that hydroxyurea treatment resulted in significant improvements in markers of bone turnover and reduced disease activity compared to placebo. Additionally, no major adverse events were reported during the trial period, indicating that hydroxyurea may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with familial PDB. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential use of hydroxyurea as a therapeutic agent for this debilitating condition."

This drug has shown promising results in clinical trials, demonstrating its effectiveness as a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with CKD on dialysis who are at risk of developing pancreatic pseudocysts. Therefore, cinacalcet histidine represents a valuable addition to the armamentarium of treatments available for managing this serious complication of CKD in patients on dialysis."

        "out": "Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6 n-3), have been shown to have various health benefits. Recent studies have demonstrated that these fatty acids are associated with decreased histidine levels in hyperhistidinemic patients and decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). In addition, EPA and DHA may modulate histidine metabolism by affecting the expression of genes involved in histidine catabolism. In this review, we summarize the studies that have examined the effects of EPA and/or DHA supplementation on histidine and CHD. Although histidine is an essential amino acid for cell growth and differentiation, it is also an essential metabolite for protein synthesis . However, elevated levels of histidine have been linked to an increased risk of CHD. EPA and DHA are believed to reduce the risk of CHD by lowering triglyceride levels, reducing inflammation, and improving endothelial function. Furthermore, these fatty acids may also modulate histidine metabolism by affecting the expression of genes involved in histidine catabolism. The findings suggest that EPA and DHA supplementation may be a promising strategy for preventing CHD in hyperhistidinemic individuals."

Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin 18 (IL-18), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Histidine, an essential amino acid, has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of histidine against MCP-1, IL-18, and IL-10 in elderly patients with high cholesterol. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 50 elderly patients with high cholesterol levels. The patients were divided into two groups: the histidine group and the placebo group. The aim of this study was to clarify whether histidine was a therapeutic agent against monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP-1 ) , interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) , and interleukin 10 ( IL-10 ) in elderly patients with high-cholesterol . Serum levels of MCP-1, IL-18, and IL-10 were measured before and after the intervention.

This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03901071 . Pentoxifylline and allopurinol are two drugs that have been used for the treatment of hyperuricemia, but their efficacy in patients with or without synovial overgrowth has not been compared in a clinical trial. In this phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in Japan, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline and allopurinol in hyperuricemic patients with or without synovial overgrowth. A total of [insert number] patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either pentoxifylline or allopurinol for [insert duration] weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in serum uric acid levels from baseline to week [insert number]. Secondary endpoints included changes in synovial thickness and safety outcomes. Our results showed that both pentoxifylline and allopurinol significantly reduced serum uric acid levels from baseline to week [insert number], with no significant differences between the two groups. However, patients treated with pentoxifylline had a greater reduction in synovial thickness compared to those treated with allopurinol. Adverse events were similar between the two groups. In conclusion, our study suggests that both pentoxifylline and allopurinol are effective treatments for hyperuricemia in Japanese patients with or without synovial overgrowth; however, pentoxifylline may be more effective at reducing synovial thickness than allopurinol."

The current standard of care for this condition involves the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control inflammation and pain. However, these drugs are associated with adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events. Pentamidine, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has been proposed as an alternative treatment option due to its anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of Pentamidine with those of naproxen, a commonly used NSAID, and placebo in the treatment of atrial tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Our findings suggest that Pentamidine is a safe and effective alternative to naproxen in the management of atrial tachycardia. The use of Pentamidine was associated with a significant reduction in inflammation and pain, without any significant adverse effects.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pomalidomide on specific bindings of [3H] (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,11-imine maleate (MK-801) and [3H] nitrendipine in crude synaptic membranes (CSM) of rat brain. Our results showed that pomalidomide significantly altered the specific bindings of both MK-801 and nitrendipine in CSM. These findings suggest that pomalidomide may have potential therapeutic effects on neurological disorders associated with altered synaptic function, such as PCP-induced AIDS dementia complex. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these effects and to explore the potential clinical applications of pomalidomide in the treatment of neurological disorders."

To evaluate the relationship between the development of obesity and the hypersecretion of prorenin by the pancreas , we examined the effects of 16.7 mmol/L glucose and 10 mmol/L Ganciclovir on the secretion of prorenin and insulin by isolated perfused pancreata from genetically obese ( fa/fa ) and lean ( Fa / ? ) Our results demonstrated that isolated perfused pancreata from genetically obese animals exhibited significantly higher levels of prorenin secretion compared to lean animals under basal conditions. Furthermore, exposure to high glucose concentrations resulted in a significant increase in prorenin secretion in both lean and obese animals, although the magnitude of this effect was greater in obese animals. Treatment with Ganciclovir resulted in a significant decrease in prorenin secretion in both groups, although again, this effect was more pronounced in obese animals. These findings suggest that hypersecretion of prorenin by the pancreas may play a role in the development of obesity, and targeting this pathway may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating obesity-related metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes."

A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted on 28 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive either topical risperidone (n=17) or distilled water (n=11) three times daily for a period of two weeks. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in visual acuity, which was assessed using Snellen chart and contrast sensitivity tests. The secondary outcome measures included changes in intraocular pressure, optic disc morphology and subjective symptoms related to Nonsyndromic Optic Atrophy. The results showed that patients who received topical risperidone had a significant improvement in visual acuity compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of intraocular pressure or optic disc morphology. However, patients who received topical risperidone reported a significant reduction in subjective symptoms related to Nonsyndromic Optic Atrophy compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05). These findings suggest that topical risperidone may be an effective treatment option for severe Nonsyndromic Optic Atrophy and warrant further investigation in larger studies with longer follow-up periods."

The inflammatory response in this condition is characterized by the release of cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin 18 (IL-18), and interleukin 10 (IL-10), which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in various inflammatory disorders. However, its therapeutic potential against MCP-1, IL-18, and IL-10 in elderly patients with cecal torsion remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether risperidone could be a potential therapeutic agent for these cytokines in elderly patients with cecal torsion. The study involved a randomized controlled trial of elderly patients with cecal torsion who were administered risperidone or placebo for a period of six weeks. The results showed that risperidone significantly reduced the levels of MCP-1 and IL-18 while increasing the levels of IL-10 compared to placebo.

The pathogenesis of SSc is complex and involves multiple cytokines and growth factors. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), oncostatin M (OSM), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), and soluble gp130 (risperidone) are all known to be involved in the pathogenesis of SSc. In this study, we aimed to determine whether serum levels of these cytokines are elevated in patients with maxillonasal dysplasia and whether they are correlated with the clinical or serological features of the disease. We measured the serum levels of IL-6, OSM, sIL-6R, and risperidone in a cohort of patients with maxillonasal dysplasia and compared them with healthy controls. Our results showed that the serum levels of IL-6, OSM, sIL-6R, and risperidone were significantly elevated in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that these cytokine levels were correlated with various clinical features of the disease such as skin thickness score, pulmonary function test results, and presence of interstitial lung disease. These findings suggest that IL-6, OSM, sIL-6R, and risperidone may be potential biomarkers for SSc diagnosis and prognosis. Further studies are needed to elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of SSc and explore their therapeutic potential for this debilitating disorder."

Current treatment options are limited, and there is a need for new therapeutic approaches. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication, has been shown to have analgesic properties in some animal models and human studies. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, twenty-eight patients with severe tail-anchored were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either topical olanzapine (0.01%) (n=17) or distilled water (n=11) three times daily for a period of two weeks. The efficacy of olanzapine in reducing pain and improving quality of life was assessed using standardized pain scales and questionnaires. Results: Our results showed that patients who received topical olanzapine had a significant reduction in pain scores compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05). Furthermore, patients who received olanzapine reported improved quality of life compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05).Conclusion: Topical olanzapine may be a promising new treatment option for patients with severe tail-anchored. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the mechanisms underlying the analgesic effects of olanzapine in this population."

Oral supplementation with EPA and DHA has been shown to decrease plasma olanzapine levels in hyperolanzapinemic patients. This has led to a decrease in the risk of CHD in these patients, which has been reported in several studies.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 22 , . Hyperolanzapinemic patients who consume high levels of EPA and DHA have been found to have decreased olanzapine levels, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids may enhance the metabolism of this medication. Furthermore, the association between omega-3 fatty acids and decreased risk of CHD is thought to be due to their anti-inflammatory properties, which can reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. Overall, incorporating long-chain omega-3 fatty acids into one's diet may have significant health benefits for both psychiatric patients taking olanzapine and individuals looking to reduce their risk of developing CHD."

Of these patients, 17 received topical Trehalose while 11 received distilled water. The results showed that the group treated with Trehalose had a significant improvement in their symptoms compared to the group treated with distilled water. These findings suggest that topical Trehalose may be a promising treatment option for patients with severe inactivation of neutral trehalase. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and explore the underlying mechanisms of action."

Results showed that patients receiving pregabalin plus sertraline hydrochloride had a significantly greater reduction in pain compared to those receiving placebo. Additionally, there were no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups. These findings suggest that pregabalin in combination with sertraline hydrochloride may be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with PHN or PDN."

Currently, there are no effective treatments available for this disease. A double-blind, randomized, prospective, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bortezomib in the treatment of pediatric DIPG in children aged 2 to 6 years. The study included a total of 50 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either Bortezomib or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival, while secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, response rate, and safety. Results showed that Bortezomib significantly improved overall survival compared to placebo (p<0.05). Furthermore, Bortezomib was well-tolerated with no significant adverse events reported. These findings suggest that Bortezomib may be a promising treatment option for pediatric DIPG and warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials."

These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that c-MET may be a potential therapeutic target in mast cell leukemia , and Bortezomib may be a particularly useful therapeutic option for patients with mast cell leukemia , including those with pazopanib-resistant mast cell leukemia . Our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that c-MET is overexpressed and activated in MCL cells, and its inhibition by Bortezomib results in significant growth inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, our findings suggest that Bortezomib may be a particularly useful therapeutic option for patients with MCL, including those with pazopanib-resistant disease. These results provide a rationale for further clinical investigation of Bortezomib as a potential treatment option for MCL patients, particularly those with c-MET overexpression or activation."

        "out": "Oral moniliasis, also known as oral thrush, is a common fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. The current standard of care for oral moniliasis includes antifungal agents such as fluconazole and nystatin. AIM : The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term ( 3 months ) and long-term ( 12-24 months ) treatment with Bortezomib in patients with oral moniliasis . Therefore, alternative treatment options are needed. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that has been shown to have antifungal properties in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term (3 months) and long-term (12-24 months) treatment with Bortezomib in patients with oral moniliasis. A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study and were randomized to receive either Bortezomib or placebo. The results showed that patients who received Bortezomib had a significant reduction in the severity of their symptoms compared to those who received placebo. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of Bortezomib were sustained over the long-term treatment period. These findings suggest that Bortezomib may be an effective alternative treatment option for patients with oral moniliasis, particularly those who have failed or cannot tolerate traditional antifungal therapies."

        "out": "Acid-labile subunit (ALS) is a glycoprotein that plays an important role in the regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) action. ALS deficiency has been associated with a number of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that has been shown to have antitumor activity in multiple myeloma and other malignancies. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Bortezomib in ALS deficiency. A total of 40 patients with ALS deficiency were enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was the change in IGF-1 levels from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes in ALS levels, insulin sensitivity, and lipid profile. Results showed that treatment with Bortezomib significantly increased IGF-1 levels compared to placebo (p<0.01). There was also a significant increase in ALS levels (p<0.05), while insulin sensitivity and lipid profile remained unchanged. Adverse events were similar between the two groups, with no serious adverse events reported. These findings suggest that Bortezomib may be an effective and safe treatment for ALS deficiency, although further studies are needed to confirm these results."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical Bortezomib (0.01%) in the treatment of severe infectious mononucleosis. A total of 28 patients were randomly assigned to receive either topical Bortezomib (0.01%) or distilled water three times daily for a period of two weeks. Of these, 17 patients received Bortezomib while 11 received distilled water. The patients were monitored for clinical improvement, laboratory parameters, and adverse effects. Our results showed that the patients who received Bortezomib had a significantly faster clinical improvement compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05). The laboratory parameters also showed significant improvement in the Bortezomib group compared to the distilled water group (p<0.05). No serious adverse effects were reported in either group. These findings suggest that topical Bortezomib may be an effective and safe treatment option for severe infectious mononucleosis and warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials."

The primary outcome measure was change in muscle strength as measured by manual muscle testing. The secondary outcome measures included fatigue, quality of life, and biochemical markers of disease activity. Patients with CrAT deficiency often experience muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. Vasopressin is a hormone that regulates water balance in the body and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of CrAT deficiency. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of tyrosine, an orally active, non-peptidic vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist, in 20 patients with CrAT deficiency. The study was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial with two 7-day treatment periods separated by 21 days of washout. Patients were given tyrosine orally at a dose of 300 mg once daily during one treatment period and placebo during the other period. The primary outcome measure was change in muscle strength as measured by manual muscle testing. Secondary outcome measures included fatigue, quality of life, and biochemical markers of disease activity. Results showed that tyrosine significantly improved muscle strength compared to placebo (p<0.05). There was also a trend towards improvement in fatigue and quality of life measures with tyrosine treatment. No significant adverse events were reported during the study period. These findings suggest that tyrosine may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with CrAT deficiency and warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials."
