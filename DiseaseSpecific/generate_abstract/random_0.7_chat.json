Acetazolamide is an orally active, non-peptidic vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist that has been studied in various clinical settings.\n\nMethods: In this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, twenty patients with iliac stenoses were given acetazolamide orally (300 mg once daily) for two 7-day periods of treatment separated by 21 days of washout. The efficacy and safety of acetazolamide were evaluated by measuring renal function parameters including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine output, and blood pressure.\n\nResults: The results showed that acetazolamide significantly improved renal function parameters compared to placebo. Specifically, GFR increased by 12% (p<0.05) and urine output increased by 23% (p<0.01) during treatment with acetazolamide compared to placebo. Blood pressure remained stable during the study period and no serious adverse events were reported.\n\nConclusion: Acetazolamide, an orally active, non-peptidic vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist, is a safe and effective treatment for improving renal function in patients with iliac stenoses. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential benefits of acetazolamide in other clinical settings."

The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors has gained popularity in the management of perforated appendicitis due to their anti-inflammatory properties. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of prasugrel, a COX-2 inhibitor, with those of naproxen, an NSAID, and placebo in the treatment of perforated appendicitis. A total of 120 patients were included in the study and were randomly assigned to receive prasugrel, naproxen, or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to resolution of symptoms and signs of inflammation. Secondary endpoints included length of hospital stay, need for surgical intervention, and adverse events. Results showed that prasugrel and naproxen were both effective in reducing inflammation and symptoms compared to placebo. However, prasugrel had a faster time to resolution of symptoms than naproxen. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the three groups. In conclusion, both prasugrel and naproxen are safe and effective treatments for perforated appendicitis with prasugrel showing a faster time to symptom resolution."

There are several treatment options available for CTS, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Biotin is a COX-2 inhibitor that has been suggested as a potential treatment option for CTS. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Biotin with those of naproxen, a commonly used NSAID, and placebo in the treatment of CTS. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in which patients with CTS were randomly assigned to receive either Biotin, naproxen or placebo for a period of 4 weeks. The results showed that both Biotin and naproxen were more effective than placebo in reducing pain and improving function in patients with CTS. However, there was no significant difference between Biotin and naproxen in terms of efficacy or safety. These findings suggest that Biotin may be a safe and effective alternative to NSAIDs for the treatment of CTS."

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are frequently used to manage the associated pain and inflammation. Gangliosides, a type of COX-2 inhibitor, have been suggested as an alternative treatment option for villo-mucinous cystadenoma. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of Gangliosides with those of naproxen, an NSAID, and placebo in the treatment of villo-mucinous cystadenoma. A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 200 patients with confirmed diagnosis of villo-mucinous cystadenoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either Gangliosides, naproxen, or placebo for 6 weeks. Results showed that both Gangliosides and naproxen significantly reduced pain and inflammation compared to placebo. However, there were no significant differences in efficacy or safety between Gangliosides and naproxen. Therefore, it can be concluded that Gangliosides may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option for villo-mucinous cystadenoma."

These findings suggest that Furosemide may have an impact on the central nervous system by altering the function of ion channels and calcium channels. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these effects and their potential implications for patients receiving Furosemide therapy."

The emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has further complicated the management of TB. Hydroxyurea, an antineoplastic agent, has been shown to have antimicrobial properties against Mtb in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term (3 months) and long-term (12-24 months) treatment with hydroxyurea in patients with virulent Erdman Mtb. A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study and were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxyurea or standard anti-TB therapy. The results showed that both short-term and long-term treatment with hydroxyurea significantly reduced the bacterial load in sputum samples compared to standard therapy alone. Furthermore, patients who received long-term treatment with hydroxyurea had a significantly lower rate of relapse compared to those who received short-term treatment or standard therapy alone. These findings suggest that hydroxyurea may be a promising adjunctive therapy for TB and warrants further investigation in larger clinical trials."

Beta-agonists, such as formoterol and albuterol, are commonly used to alleviate asthma symptoms by relaxing the airway smooth muscle.

In this study, we undertook a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to investigate the effects of a single dose of formoterol inhaled via Turbuhaler (12 micrograms) and of albuterol inhaled via Turbuhaler (200 micrograms) on airway responsiveness to AMP and pentoxifylline in 16 subjects with mild monocytosis. The results showed that both formoterol and albuterol significantly improved airway responsiveness to AMP compared to placebo.

These findings suggest that beta-agonists may have differential effects on airway responsiveness depending on the underlying inflammatory state of the airways. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these differential effects and their clinical implications for patients with mild monocytosis and asthma."

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline in patients with facial melasma. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in major electronic databases up to September 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of pentoxifylline on facial melasma compared to placebo or other interventions. The outcomes of interest were improvement in the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score, adverse events, and patient satisfaction. A total of six studies involving 402 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that pentoxifylline significantly reduced MASI score compared to placebo or other interventions (weighted mean difference -2.32; 95% confidence interval -3.54 to -1.10; p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in adverse events between the pentoxifylline group and the control group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.70; p=0.59).

Twenty patients were enrolled in a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study with two 7-day periods of treatment separated by 21 days of washout. Patients received either pentamidine (300 mg once daily) or placebo orally during each treatment period.\n\nRESULTS: Pentamidine treatment was well-tolerated and did not result in any serious adverse events. Compared to placebo, pentamidine treatment resulted in significant improvements in ataxia symptoms as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score (p<0.05). Additionally, pentamidine treatment improved patients' quality of life as measured by the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire (p<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pentamidine is a safe and effective treatment for hereditary ataxia SCA28 and may provide a new therapeutic option for patients with this debilitating disorder.

Current treatment options are limited, and there is a need for new therapies that can effectively manage this condition. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topical ganciclovir in the treatment of severe right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nMethods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 28 patients with severe right ventricular hypertrophy. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either topical ganciclovir (0.01%) or distilled water three times daily for a period of two weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change in right ventricular mass index (RVMI) as determined by echocardiography.\n\nResults: The results showed that patients who received topical ganciclovir had a significantly greater reduction in RVMI compared to those who received distilled water (p<0.05). Specifically, the mean reduction in RVMI was 17% in the ganciclovir group compared to 6% in the distilled water group. No serious adverse events were reported during the study.\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that topical ganciclovir may be an effective treatment option for severe right ventricular hypertrophy.

Our results showed that topical risperidone significantly reduced the number of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles compared to distilled water treatment. Furthermore, risperidone treatment led to a significant decrease in the expression levels of clathrin and dynamin proteins. These findings suggest that topical risperidone may be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of severe CME and related disorders."

The current standard of care for synovial cysts involves surgical intervention, but this approach is associated with a number of risks and complications. As such, there is a need for alternative treatment options that are both safe and effective. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of synovial cysts. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in preclinical studies. In this randomized controlled trial, patients with synovial cysts were treated with either olanzapine or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in cyst volume as measured by MRI. Secondary endpoints included pain scores, functional outcomes, and adverse events. Results showed that olanzapine significantly reduced cyst volume compared to placebo (p<0.05) and was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. These findings suggest that olanzapine may be a safe and effective non-surgical treatment option for patients with synovial cysts, though further research is needed to confirm these results."

        "in": "OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bortezomib in the treatment of Acid-labile subunit .",
        "out": "Acid-labile subunit (ALS) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that leads to short stature and insulin resistance. There is currently no effective treatment for ALS deficiency. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in the treatment of ALS deficiency. A total of 12 patients with genetically confirmed ALS deficiency were enrolled in this open-label trial. Patients received Bortezomib intravenously twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in height standard deviation score (SDS) after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included changes in insulin resistance, lipid profile, and liver function tests. Results showed that Bortezomib significantly improved height SDS by 0.4 (p < 0.001) after 12 weeks of treatment. There was also a significant improvement in insulin resistance, as measured by HOMA-IR (p = 0.01). No serious adverse events were reported during the study period. These findings suggest that Bortezomib may be a safe and effective treatment option for ALS deficiency, although further studies are needed to confirm these results and determine long-term efficacy and safety."

        "out": "Hairy leukoplakia is a disease caused by the Epstein-Barr virus that affects the oral mucosa and is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals. Current treatment options are limited and often ineffective. In this study, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in the treatment of hairy leukoplakia. Our results showed that Bortezomib was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the severity and duration of symptoms associated with hairy leukoplakia. These findings suggest that Bortezomib may be a promising new treatment option for this debilitating disease. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of Bortezomib in the treatment of hairy leukoplakia."

        "out": "Citrullinemia type II (CTLN2) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiencies are also associated with hyperammonemia. Creatine transporter deficiency (CrTD) is another rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene that encodes the creatine transporter protein. CrTD patients suffer from intellectual disability, speech delay, and behavioral problems. Severe CrAT deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC25A20 gene that encodes the mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase. The clinical features of CrAT deficiency include hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, and cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of topical Bortezomib (0.01%) in patients with severe CrAT deficiency. Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive either topical Bortezomib or distilled water three times daily for a period of two weeks. The results showed that topical Bortezomib was well-tolerated and resulted in significant improvement in symptoms compared to distilled water treatment. These findings suggest that topical Bortezomib may be a promising treatment option for patients with severe CrAT deficiency. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and determine the optimal dosing regimen for this therapy."
