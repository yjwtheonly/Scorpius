            "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in arterial walls, leading to the formation of plaques. Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice are widely used as a model of atherosclerosis due to their high susceptibility to the development of plaques when fed a high-fat diet. In this study, we examined the effects of treatment with a selective elastin inhibitor ( Pregabalin ) and a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor ( SC-236 ) on the development and progression of atherogenic plaques in apoE -/- mice . Mice were treated with either Pregabalin, SC-236, or vehicle and were monitored for plaque development. Our results showed that treatment with both Pregabalin and SC-236 significantly reduced plaque formation compared to vehicle-treated mice. These findings suggest that selective inhibition of elastin and COX-2 may be effective strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.",

Apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice are widely used as a model of atherosclerosis due to their high susceptibility to the development of plaques when fed a high-fat diet. In this study, we investigated the effects of two inhibitors, Pregabalin and SC-236, on atherosclerotic plaque formation in apoE-/- mice fed a 1% cholesterol diet. Mice were treated with either Pregabalin, SC-236, or vehicle and were monitored for plaque development.
